1. Static variable is same for all the objects.
2. Static blocks loads when class is created and it loads only once bcz class created only once
3. But Constructor get all as many times when objects created.
4. You have to make static if you want to access a variable from static method(psvm).
5. if Child class method overrides the parent class method is called method overriding.
6. Binding data with methods is called Encapsulation. Your variable must be private.
7. What is wrapper class.
8. abstract keyword is a non-access modifier and for example abstaract class cannot be used to create      any object. It can be inheritated and then object can be created.
9. Final Keyword :
    a) With variable: it can  not change the value for that variable it is treated as constant.
    b) With Class: It can  not be Inheritated.
    c)  With Method: It can not Override method with final keyword.
10. Interface : With the help of Interface we can acheive multiple inheritance,You can not create object of interface, all the method of interface are public abstract by default.
11. Anonymous Class:
12. Access modifier:
       a) final
       b) abstract
       c) private     [specific class]
        d) public (by default)  [Any class or package]
       e) protected [subsiding classes]

      * private and protected can not be used with class we can use it only in inner classes.

13.  try 
        catch (multiple catches can used for different types of error handling.)  
        final (final block will execute whether try or catch was executed.)        
        Redundancy is a crime and we don't want to be a criminal.  
        
14. Multi-Threading
